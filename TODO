- A desktop or web app to keep track of everything:
    - compare laps from different rounds, days, etc... on the same track

QT App:
 - Database:
     - rounds, laps and so on... associated with tracks, so I ca keep storical laps per track
     - Datetime for rounds and laps
 - Change "status" tab for "live", and start/stop live data on focus/loose focus.
 - Laps table should display rounds, dates, etc...
 - autodetect track on gps data (like: make a big square on the track gps coordinates), show track name in UI
 - SET DATETIME on gps info, notify on UI (show datetime and last sync with gps data)
 - Remove: pressure, temperature, compass, and live button

Laptimer:
 - ensure that all lap counters include the check like "if time_since_last_chckpoint < 5seconds, continue"

Arduino App:
 - change gear gathering frequency from 8 to 4-5


- Clear arduino code:
    - remove libs not used
    - remove test/old projects
    - clean up documentation in code and in doc folder


Wish:
 - accelerator % sensor
 - break sensor
 - rear camera
 - suspension sensors
